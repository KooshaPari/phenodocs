# Reconcile Sprint: Open PR Waves (2026-02-26)

## Scope

- Reconcile and stabilize open PRs for: `cliproxyapi++`, `cliproxyapi-plusplus`, `thegent`, `agentapi-plusplus`.
- Primary outputs:
  - Stacked-PR governance handbook update.
  - Concrete merge/resolve sequence for active open PR sets.
  - Git-backed documentation checkpoint for future handoff.

## Current Audit Snapshot

- `cliproxyapi++`: no open PRs.
- `agentapi-plusplus`: no open PRs.
- `thegent`: 8 open PRs.
  - Clean: #493, #496
  - `CodeRabbit` failures currently visible on: #494
- `cliproxyapi-plusplus`: last stable snapshot observed 101 open PRs (live fetch blocked by transient GitHub API 502).
  - Clean candidates from that snapshot: #618, #508, #514
  - Total unresolved threads: 27
  - Total check-failing PRs: 96
  - Total CodeRabbit-failing PRs: 86

## Immediate Actions

1. Re-run live `gh` fetch for `cliproxyapi-plusplus` once API is stable.
2. Promote known clean PRs only when:
   - failing checks = none
   - unresolved review threads = 0
3. For all PRs with `CodeRabbit` failure, post:
   - `@coderabbitai full review`
4. Resolve review-thread debt in stack order, then merge by dependency chain.
5. Keep canonical `main` branches untouched until explicit upstream pull/merge step.

## Executed Sweep

- `cliproxyapi-plusplus`: posted `@coderabbitai full review` to 86 `CodeRabbit`-failing PRs from the latest local snapshot.
- `thegent`: posted `@coderabbitai full review` to 2 `CodeRabbit`-failing PRs (#494, #478).
- Snapshot-driven run was intentionally used while API pagination intermittently returned 502 for fresh listing.

## Canonical Docs

- Added module: [`docs/governance/stacked-prs/05-pr-reconciliation.md`](../governance/stacked-prs/05-pr-reconciliation.md)
- Updated index: [`docs/governance/stacked-prs/README.md`](../governance/stacked-prs/README.md)
